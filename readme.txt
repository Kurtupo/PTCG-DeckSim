Hello everyone!
This is my code for my Pokemon Trading Card Game simulator I used in my
video series, which you can watch here:
[VIDEO SERIES NOT YET AVAILABLE]

Please note that there is a separate companion series specifically
dedicated to going over the simulator, which you can find here:
[VIDEO SERIES NOT YET AVAILABLE]

To differentiate between the two video series, I'll be referring to the
"main series" as "Cases" and the video series going over the simulator as
"Episodes". I'll be referring to the overall endeavor as the "project".
I know this isn't particularlly intuitive but hopefully it's enough to
follow along.

Each "Case" (video in the main series) focuses on exploring a specific
deckbuilding topic in the Pokemon Trading Card Game.
For example, the first Case explores the odds of having a certain card in
the opening hand.

Each "Episode" in this project refers to the code used in the corresponding
"Case" (video in the main series). That is to say, the simulator evolves
over the course of the series to fit the needs of each Case.
There is no "one big simulator" in this project. Instead, several similar
simulators, each for exploring one Case.
Of course, each subsequent simulator will naturally share code and
functions with the last.

FAQ
    Q: Why is all this written in MATLAB? Why not something like Python?
    A: To be honest, it's a matter of personal convenience. I use MATLAB
        both in school and in other personal projects so it's simply what
        I'm comfortable with.
        To put it simply, I want to spend more time exploring the
        situations presented in the video series and less time debugging.
        
        In later Episodes, both the topics explored and the simulator
        itself naturally become more complex. Many of these topics are not
        well known by PTCG players - sometimes not know at all! - and thus
        I'm more focused on presenting information that will help players
        improve.
        
        Perhaps in the future I'll redo this project in something more
        common like Python.
    
    Q: When can I expect the next video in either series to release?
    A: The Cases and Episodes have different "peoduction timelines" and
        require different skills.

        Writing the code for each Case & Episode is easy enough and
        naturally comes first. All it really requires is for me to be at my
        computer and allow myself enough time to design, write, and debug
        the code.
        After completing the code, I then write the outline (I can't follow
        scripts D: ) for each Case and then begin the cycle of practicing,
        recording, editing, creating the thumbnail, etc...
        There's just a lot of work that goes into making each video, both
        technical and creative, so those take quite a bit of time to
        complete.
        Since Episodes are often just a blend of "code walkthrough" and
        follow up to each video, not nearly enough work is required to
        finish those.

        I try to make sure both a Case and its corresponding Episode
        release at the same time, so the code may not be released even
        though the code is "finished". I tend to work on each Case &
        Episode with the next ones in mind so if you really are curious as
        to what's coming up next, feel free to reach out to me!

    Q: I noticed there's more stuff than your code here on Github. What's
        up with that?
    A: Although the simulator code is the main focus of each Episode, I've
        left a few extra goodies here on Github as well! You'll be able to
        find thumbnails, "slides", and other graphics I use for each video.
        In essence, I want Github to be a record of this entire project,
        not "just the code".

        That said, these extras may not represent the "final release" of
        the corresponding videos. The "slides" are often changed up to the
        very day of release and thumbnails can be changed even after the
        video is released!

    Q: Do you play the Pokemon Trading Card Game competitively?
    A: Yes, but actually no. I play the Expanded format competitively but
        I have yet to attend a big premier tournament - in no small part
        due to the lack of official Expanded tournaments. Perhaps with the
        release of Pokemon Trading Card Game Live and Ranked Expanded
        alongside it, I'll be able to prove how busted my Devolution
        Control deck is :)
